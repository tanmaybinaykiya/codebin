This is the public repository of Tanmay Binaykiya.\
This project has some routines to convert a given polygonal mesh to a subdivisional mesh
Currently it supports only Catmull Clark Subdivisional Algorithm.



Limitations : 	The max number of vertices, faces has to be harcoded. 
 					The edge points are duplicated.
					The faces are defined using vertex indices in the C/AC direction of the vertex face

					
***** EDGE POINT CALCULATION IS WRONG:  facePt Computation remaining **** 

COMPILATION:

The code has been written in Linux Ubuntu 12.04 Distro;
usleep() may have to bre replaced by sleep() in windows.

Compiled with gcc using the usual arguments 
gcc "TRAYNEW.c" -lglut -lGLU -lGL -o "TRAYNEW"

RUN USING ./TRAYNEW

INPUT(OBJECT) FILE FORMAT
# LINE SIZE should be less than 128
# All Indexes start from 0
# Vertex format: v x,y,z 
# quad format: f v1,v2,v3,v4
