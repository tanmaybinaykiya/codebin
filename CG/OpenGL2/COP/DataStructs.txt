My Data Structure
Every face is bounded by edges.
EVery Edge is defined by two vertices.
Every Vertex is defined using 3 floats. (x, y, z). 

Every edge is a part of a face. 
Every vertex is a prt of an edge.

face{
	edge *edges[];
}
edge{
	vertex *vertices[2];
	face *faces[2];
}
vertex{
	float x,y,z;
	edge *edges[];
}
