This was an academic project on Computer Graphics (CSE410) in my final year of undergrad. 
[check the sample outputs here: https://plus.google.com/photos/115501164641942284111/albums/5696817713265988945]

This is a simple demonstration of a Ray Tracer. Written completely in C++, integrated with OpenGL for visual control. Whole CodeBlocks project(Ubuntu) is uploaded. After configuring CodeBlocks (in Ubuntu) for opengl, open the project with "RayTracer.cbp" file. Build and run with user persmission.

The opengl Camera movement is as follows:

Up Arrow:		Move Front
[Shift]Up Arrow:	Move Up

Down Arrow:		Move Back
[Shift]Down Arrow:	Move Down

Right Arrow:		Turn Right
Left Arrow:		Turn Left

Page Up:		Pitch Up
Page Down:		Pitch Down

Home:			Roll Right
End:			Roll Left

Press 'r' to render the RayTracing image. The images will be generated in "images" directory.
