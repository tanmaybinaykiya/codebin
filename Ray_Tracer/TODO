Urgent:
-------
* Complete OpenGL lighting (bugs in DARKORCHID sphere!)
* Check Full Internal Reflection
* Remove unnecessary code
* Comment where necessary



Future plan:
------------
* incorporate global ambient light
* Try to generalize the checkerboard with finite/infinite plane
* Create some fancy shapes like tetrahedron with triangles and Spheres.
* Check with different refracting indices
* Create different worlds
* experiment with multiple lighting
